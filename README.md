# Directed Reading Program Proposed Projects

The Math Union at the University of Toronto is pleased to invite undergraduate students to participate in the mini directed reading program. You will be put in a group of 3-5 with an upper year student who will guide you to read some math literature of their choice. If you are interested, please use this [form](https://forms.gle/JaSKHg46Qq1pMi8r9) to sign up and rank your top 3 projects that you'd like to participate in. The program will start mid October and last until the end of this semester. There will be a final presentation that you are encouraged to take part and share what you learned with your peers.

Expected Commitment: You are expected to meet your mentor either in person or online for one hour a week for about 6 weeks, and read the literature assigned.  The final presentation is optional and the exact date will be announced closer to the end of the semester. 

The forms closes at Oct 5, Sunday, 23:59.

## Project 1

#### Topic: Knot Theory

#### Mentor: William Gao

#### Material Will be Covered:

We will cover a selection of topics from Adams Knot Book, starting from the basic definitions of knots including Reidemeister moves, some invariants, and complements. An ambitious goal would be to talk about the Poincaré Conjecture.

#### Expected Prerequisites:

Some familiarity with topology may be useful, although we will develop all the topology we need.

#### Intended Students:

Any students interested in knot theory or topology.

## Project 2

#### Topic: Topology

#### Mentor: John Chakkour

#### Material Will be Covered:

What is a topology? Open/closed sets, basis for a topology, continuous functions, product topology, metric spaces… other topics time permitting

#### Expected Prerequisites:

Mathematical maturity.

#### Intended Students:

First or second year math spec.

## Project 3

#### Topic: Topology

#### Mentor: Isaac Clark

#### Material Will be Covered:

A few notions from topology: open and closed sets, compactness, connectedness, continuity, metric spaces.

Topology of R^n: Heine-Borel, completeness, Bolzano-Weinerstrass, topological formulations of IVT and EVT.

#### Expected Prerequisites:

High school calculus, familiarity with quantifiers, ideally: the first month of MAT137 or MAT157.

#### Intended Students:

First year students, enrolled in either MAT137 or MAT157, who are planning on taking higher math courses.

## Project 4

#### Topic: Introduction to Vector Bundles

#### Mentor: Ruslan Erdnigor

#### Material Will be Covered:

Based mainly on A. Mishchenko's book 'Vector Bundles and Threir Applications' and J. Milnor and J. Stasheff's book 'Characteristic Classes'.

Participants of this group will become acquainted with vector bundles with structures and principal bundles and their basic topological invariants, characteristic classes. Both the topological 'obstruction' viewpoint and the smooth 'connection' viewpoint on characteristic classes will be discussed, in proportion depending on the participants' preference. To the necessary extent, singular and de Rham cohomology theories will be discussed as well, but those are not strictly required as prerequisites.

#### Expected Prerequisites:

Good understanding of linear algebra (real and complex vector spaces, matrices, eigenvalues, trace, characteristic polynomial; inner products, groups GL(n), O(n), U(n)); basic group theory (groups, subgroups, cosets, group actions); basic point-set topology (familiarity with topological spaces and continuous maps); basic smooth manifold theory (smooth manifolds, smooth functions, vector fields, differential forms and the exterior differential).

#### Intended Students:

Second- (and higher-) year specialists, interested upper-year majors.

## Project 5

#### Topic: Character Theory

#### Mentor: Kristopher Zhao

#### Material Will be Covered:

Linear representation of finite groups, focused on character theory. Mostly following Serre’s Linear Representation of Finite Groups.

#### Expected Prerequisites:

Familiar with group theory. Taking 301/347 concurrently is fine.

#### Intended Students:

Second (and higher) year math spec.

## Project 6

#### Topic: Introduction to Set Theory

#### Mentor: Ceren Sahin

#### Material Will be Covered:

Classical Set Theory by Derek Goldrei chapters 1-6.

#### Expected Prerequisites:

Interest in math, willingness to sit and think.

#### Intended Students:

First and second year math spec.


## Project 7

#### Topic: Classical Algebraic Geometry

#### Mentor: Bo Gao

#### Material Will be Covered:

DOLGACHEV, Classical Algebraic Geometry: a modern
view or A Royal Road to Algebraic Geometry by Holme or others.

#### Expected Prerequisites:

high school algebra, abstract algebra (rings and modules) preferred. Basic geometry. Category theory and topology for higher category theory.

#### Intended Students:

People with basic knowledge of algebra and geometry. 

## Project 8

#### Topic: p-adic Groups and Their Representations

#### Mentor: Zander Karaganis

#### Material Will be Covered:

An introduction to p-adic numbers, group theory, and ring theory.
From here, either I will propose participants classify quadratic forms over Q_p (including p=2), or anisotropic tori for SL(2) or SO(4)/SO(5), all the tori coming from quadratic forms.
Time permitting, we will use these tori to construct a bulk of the irreducible representations of these groups, under mild restrictions on the prime $p$.
This is connected to a recent problem of describing representations through a representation theoretic version of the local character expansion.

#### Expected Prerequisites:

Mat224/247, MAT137/157, (Preferably enrolled in: Mat301/347).

#### Intended Students:

Second year math spec and up or third year math major and up.

## Project 9

#### Topic: Hyperbolic Geometry

#### Mentor: Zander Karaganis

#### Material Will be Covered:

Geodesics, Isometries of the plane, Poincare disc model, triangles.

#### Expected Prerequisites:

Know what C is. Integration on manifolds useful but not at all required.

#### Intended Students:

Anyone. There will be some repetition if you've already taken complex analysis.

## Project 10

#### Topic: Intro ML

#### Mentor: Bradley Boratto

#### Material Will be Covered:

My knowledge right now goes as far as building neural networks - I'm very open to reading papers myself to develop the DRG further but that's probably a good starting point.

#### Expected Prerequisites:
Ideally not calculus/linear algebra but might be necessary.


#### Intended Students:

Anyone interested but I imagine my target cluster is 1/2nd year Math/CS/Physics.
